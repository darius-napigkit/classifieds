== General Information

Here's an attempt to create a Springboot Microservice that exposes a set of RESTful Web Services API
to support a Classifieds application with the following services/functionalities:

* An endpoint that allows the creation or registration of a User
* An endpoint that authenticates a User given its credentials
* An endpoint that allows an authenticated User to perform CRUD operations on listings with the
following conditions:
    ** A valid authorization token must be provided for all listing operations
    ** The authenticated User can create multiple listings
    ** Only the User that created the corresponding listing can update or delete it
    ** Only authenticated User can query for listings
